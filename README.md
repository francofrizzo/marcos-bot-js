# MarcosBot

MarcosBot is a [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) that generates random messages based on what it has read before. It is specially interesting when added to group chats.

This [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) implementation is an adaptation of a [previous Python version](https://github.com/francofrizzo/marcos-bot) of the bot. The new code is more organized and clear, but some features have not been ported yet; those are detailed in the [Issues section](https://github.com/francofrizzo/marcos-bot-js/issues).

## How it works

For generating the messages, the bot uses a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain). Each word used in the chat is represented by a state in the chain. The usage of two words together in a message results in the link between those words being strenghtened.

New messages are generated by a random walk on the system, which means that every word is directly related only with its immediately previous and next words. Therefore, the messages are vaguely resembling of typical messages in the chat, but frequently incoherent or unexpectedly comic.

## Running the bot

After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and the required packages (`npm install`), the code must be compiled (`node_modules/.bin/tsc -p .` if run from the root directory of the project).

You must create a Telegram Bot and get its [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) token; replace with this token the contents of `token` entry in the `local/config.json` file before running the bot.

Then, you can start listening to messages by simply running
```
node dist/Test.js
```
(which is a horrible way to do it and [has to be changed soon](https://github.com/francofrizzo/marcos-bot-js/issues/9)).
